# Iris Dataset EDA using R & ggplot2

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using R.
The goal is to understand relationships between flower measurements and species.

## Tools Used
- R
- ggplot2
- dplyr

## Analysis Performed
- Species distribution
- Petal length comparison by species
- Relationship between petal length and petal width

## Key Insights
- Setosa species is clearly separable
- Petal features are strong predictors
- Dataset is clean and balanced

## How to Run
1. Open R or RStudio
2. Run `iris_eda.R`
